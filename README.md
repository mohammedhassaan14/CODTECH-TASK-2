  TASK - 02 Student Grade Tracker Program

The Student Grade Tracker Program is a Python application designed to help users efficiently manage and track student grades across various subjects or assignments. 
The program allows users to input grades for different subjects, calculate the average grade, and provide additional information such as the letter grade.

How It Works:
1. Initialization: The program initializes a dictionary to store grades for different subjects.
2. Adding Grades: Users can input grades for specific subjects. The grades are stored in the dictionary under the respective subject.
3. Calculating Average: The program calculates the average grade by summing all the grades and dividing by the total number of grades.
4. Determining Letter Grade: Based on the calculated average, the program assigns a letter grade following the standard grading scale (A, B, C, D, F).
5. Displaying Grades: Users can view the grades entered for each subject.
6. Displaying Summary: The program provides a summary of the average grade and the corresponding letter grade.
7. Menu-Driven Interface: The user interacts with the program through a simple menu that offers options to add grades, display grades, view the summary, or exit the program.

This program is particularly useful for educators and students to keep track of academic performance and easily calculate overall grades.
